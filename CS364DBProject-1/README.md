# CS364 Database Application Project

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the CS 364 course in Fall 2024. The goal was to apply database skills and concepts learned throughout the semester by designing and developing a real-world database and application. This project involved several deliverables, including a proposal, regular check-ins, a demo, and a final report.

## Project Structure

The project was structured around the following major components:

*   **Partner Sign-up:** Initial team formation.
*   **Proposal:** A detailed plan outlining the project's scope, database design, functionality, and technical requirements.
*   **Check-ins:** Weekly progress reports to ensure the project stayed on track.
*   **Demo:** A demonstration of the completed database and application.
*   **Report:** A final report documenting the completed project, including its design, functionality, and implementation.
*   **Group & Self-eval:** Evaluation of team members' contributions and project feedback.

## Deliverables

### Proposal

The proposal document describes the project in detail, covering:

*   **Problem Statement:** A clear description of the real-world problem being modeled, the data and functionality involved, and the stakeholders.
*   **Database Design:** An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and a list of tables with their attributes, illustrating the database structure.
*   **Functionality:** A description of the application's functionality, including CRUD operations and advanced queries, presented as a bulleted list or user stories.
*   **Technical Requirements:** The languages, tools, and services used for implementation, including the project modality (e.g., desktop, web), database connector, database platform, and code sharing strategy (e.g., GitHub).

### Database and Database Application

The project involved designing and implementing both a database and a database application with the following requirements:

#### Database Requirements

*   Implemented using a relational database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, or Postgres).
*   Consisting of at least five tables, with at least three represented as entity types in the ER diagram.
*   Relationships in the database design including one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.
*   Sufficient data in the database to support interesting queries and demonstrate the application's usefulness (10s of tuples in all tables and 100 or more for some applications).
*   Data integrity maintained when populating tables.
*   Data sources cited in the final report.

#### Database Application Requirements

*   A UI application (GUI preferred, command-line interface allowed with partial credit).
*   CRUD functionality for at least some of the data.
*   Use of prepared statements for secure data handling.
*   Implementation of at least three advanced queries per team member.

#### Advanced Queries

Each team member was responsible for creating and presenting at least one query in each of the following groups:

*   **Group 1:** Aggregate functions, LIKE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT.
*   **Group 2:** HAVING, OFFSET, outer join, joining four or more tables.
*   **Group 3:** Subqueries, IN, set operators, or any additional functionality.

### Check-ins

Weekly check-ins reported on progress and described goals for the next week, following an Agile-inspired structure:

*   What did you do last week?
*   What do you plan to do next week?
*   Are there any issues or questions or problems that need resolving?

### Demo

The final demo included:

*   A brief overview of the project.
*   Presentation of the ER diagram.
*   Demonstration of the database tables in an SQL tool.
*   Demonstration of the CRUD functionality of the application.
*   Demonstration of the advanced queries implemented by each team member.

### Final Report

The final report described the completed project and included the following sections:

*   All sections from the proposal, updated to reflect the finished product.
*   CRUD Screenshots: Screenshots demonstrating the CRUD functionality.
*   Advanced Query Screenshots: Screenshots demonstrating the advanced queries.
*   Normalization: A description of the database's normalization level (at least 2NF).

## Tools Used

The project allowed flexibility in the choice of tools, including relational database implementations, database connectors, and programming languages. Code repository systems like GitHub were encouraged for sharing code.

## Planning

A suggested approach to completing the project:

1.  Complete the project proposal document first.
2.  Set up and test the chosen tools/technologies.
3.  Start looking for data sources for the project.
